To change the color of highest payee amount I have used Brush class in System.Media.Brushes, to accomplish the goal my method was to find the amount value in the transaction Data Grid, a simple algorithm to find the highest amount by comparing each value in the amount coloumn and then setting the highest row background to color red.
In implementation there were many difficulties in locating the row with the amount value and also there were issue with importing brush class.
